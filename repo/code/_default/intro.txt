This code repository consists of algorithms and programs that have been successfully verified with [AutoProof](http://se.inf.ethz.ch/research/autoproof). You will find a description of each problem, a reference to where the problem was proposed (if applicable), as well as the source code of the solution. You can run the online version of AutoProof for each problem, or download the source code of the problems and run AutoProof on your machine (see the [EVE](http://se.inf.ethz.ch/research/eve) website for installation instructions).
