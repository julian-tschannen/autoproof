Source: [FAC'07](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1272668)
Abstract: A program's behaviour is selected at runtime (design pattern).
Description:
The abstract strategy class has an operation that gets refined in different subclasses. The client can write client code operating with the abstract class, while instantiating the entities with specific subclasses. Then the reasoning has to deal with the dynamic representation.
